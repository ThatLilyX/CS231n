# Assignment 3: Recurrent Networks and Advanced Topics

## Overview
This assignment covers advanced deep learning topics:
- Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)
- Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks
- Network visualization techniques
- Neural style transfer
- Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)

## Files
- `rnn.py` - Vanilla RNN implementation
- `lstm.py` - LSTM cell and network
- `image_captioning.py` - Image captioning with RNN/LSTM
- `network_visualization.py` - Saliency maps, class visualization, fooling images
- `style_transfer.py` - Neural style transfer
- `gan.py` - Generative Adversarial Network

## Key Concepts
- Sequential modeling with RNNs
- Handling long-term dependencies with LSTMs
- Visualizing what ConvNets learn
- Combining content and style in images
- Generative modeling with GANs

## Instructions
1. Implement RNN and LSTM cells from scratch
2. Build an image captioning system
3. Visualize network features and gradients
4. Implement neural style transfer
5. Train a GAN to generate images

## Datasets
- MS COCO (for image captioning)
- ImageNet (for visualization)
- Various images for style transfer
