# Assignment 1: Loss Curve Visualization

## Objective
Visualize and understand loss curves during neural network training to diagnose training issues and evaluate model performance.

## Tasks
1. Generate synthetic training data
2. Train a simple model and record loss values
3. Visualize training and validation loss curves
4. Identify common patterns (overfitting, underfitting, good fit)
5. Experiment with different learning rates and observe effects

## Files
- `loss_visualization.py` - Main implementation
- `train_model.py` - Training script with loss tracking
- `plot_curves.py` - Plotting utilities
- `loss_visualization.ipynb` - Interactive notebook

## Learning Goals
- Understand training vs validation loss
- Recognize overfitting and underfitting patterns
- Learn to diagnose training issues from loss curves
- Experiment with hyperparameters (learning rate, batch size)

## Expected Outputs
- Loss curve plots showing training/validation loss over epochs
- Comparison plots for different learning rates
- Analysis of overfitting vs underfitting scenarios
