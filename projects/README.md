# CS221n Projects

This directory contains course projects and personal experiments.

## Project Ideas

### Image Classification Projects
- Custom dataset classification (flowers, animals, etc.)
- Transfer learning with pre-trained models
- Fine-tuning for specific domains

### Object Detection Projects
- Real-time object detection with YOLO/SSD
- Custom object detector for specific use cases
- Detection performance benchmarking

### Image Segmentation Projects
- Semantic segmentation (FCN, U-Net)
- Instance segmentation (Mask R-CNN)
- Medical image segmentation

### Generative Models
- Image generation with GANs
- Style transfer applications
- Image-to-image translation

### Video Understanding
- Action recognition in videos
- Video captioning
- Temporal action detection

## Project Structure

Each project should have:
```
project_name/
├── README.md           # Project description and results
├── data/              # Dataset (gitignored)
├── models/            # Trained models (gitignored)
├── notebooks/         # Jupyter notebooks for experiments
├── src/               # Source code
│   ├── train.py       # Training script
│   ├── eval.py        # Evaluation script
│   └── model.py       # Model architecture
├── configs/           # Configuration files
└── results/           # Output visualizations and metrics
```

## Getting Started

1. Choose a project from the ideas above or propose your own
2. Create a new directory for the project
3. Write a project proposal in the README
4. Implement and iterate
5. Document results and learnings
